# Text-Adventure-Game
Project History - November 2011

This is the first project I did where the goal was to make a game, not an engine, and is also the first game I made to the point of completion. It's a pretty basic command line game that uses a rogue-like style of design to represent the house I lived in at the time of its making. It's done in the style of a text adventure game (e.g. "Move South").
